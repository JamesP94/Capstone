Progress- I had a meeting with Sun Country Airlines (SCA) today and should recieve the data for my project by the end of the week. The meeting was beneficial and set expectations for both parties. Signed an NDA to be given access to the data.

Problems- I can't help but feel a little behind. SCA explained I won't be able to access voice files as we originally planned, but they are giving me access to all  of their customer survey data from 2023. 

Plan- I plan to look over the data starting friday of this week and then come up with a more specific plan from there. Right now SCA is asking me to create categorizations from the customer survey data, which will involve text mining and creating segments, possibly doing cluster analysis as a means of exploring the data. I also plan on creating and hosting a dashboard for SCA to use to track trends in their customer survey data going forward. I'm sure this plan will change and evolve once I get the data.

Hours- 1-2
